I am using this project not only for my Dreamweaver project, but as a continuous project to improve my skills. This site is for a guild of a game that I play, and I eventually plan to have it fully functioning and working for the community and other players of the game to play. Like stated above it is a work in progress. As of now the 3 HTML files in the folder are the only working pages. If you are just going to click on my index file, then you can visit Home, About GID, and Guilds. The links in the footer and the nav bar should be working for those three pages, and the GID logo in the nav bar will take you to the home page as well. I used bootstrap in order to ensure that the layout of the site will work cross platform from large Desktops, to tablets, to smartphones.
